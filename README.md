This project automates the entire user signup and email verification process using Cypress and MailSlurp. It generates a temporary email address through the MailSlurp API, uses it to sign up on the MailSlurp Playground, waits for the verification email, extracts the 6-digit code using RegEx, and completes the verification through the UI. This end-to-end automation ensures that the signup flow is thoroughly tested without the need for real email addresses.

By integrating Cypress with MailSlurp, the project demonstrates how to automate email-based workflows efficiently. The use of custom commands (createInbox, waitForLatestEmail) and dynamic email polling makes the process reusable and scalable for future testing scenarios.
